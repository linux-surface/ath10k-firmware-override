# Firmware override for Surface devices with QCA6174 ATH10K WiFi Chip

_Note: This should no longer be required with up-to-date firmware from the official linux-firmware repository._

Firmware override for Surface devices with QCA6174 ATH10K WiFi chip,
specifically the Surface Go devices and the AMD Surface Laptops.

This workaround requires [this](https://github.com/linux-surface/kernel/commit/19d746dc9980d9109b93c9424138d3966c8a67cf) patch to work.
It does not override the previously installed firmware files and only overrides the loading procedure via the linked patch and the modprobe config in this repository.

- The `board-2.bin` file has been created by Hans de Goede based on Windows firmware files.
  See [these](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/issues/542) [issues](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/issues/41) and [this](https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware/pull/11) pull request for mored details.

### Outdated Files

- The `bus=pci,vendor=168c,device=003e,subsystem-vendor=168c,subsystem-device=3370.bin` has been obtained from the Windows installation on a Surface Go.
  See [this](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/issues/542) issue and [this](https://lore.kernel.org/ath10k/226790d7-75d8-bac3-9991-d73fa5b7df5b@hansg.org/T/#u) mailing-list post for details.

- The `board.bin` file is taken from a Killer WiFi chip and has be obtained from the [Killer support page](https://web.archive.org/web/20201111213909/http://www.killernetworking.com/support/K1535_Debian/board.bin).
  Please note that this is not the correct board file for either the Surface Laptop 3 and Surface Go, but seems to work anyways.
